# ModelConverter

a small program with plugin based support for several 3D model formats. In main the features are the following: 

* import and export of Wavefront `obj` files
* import and export of Emergency 3 & 4 `v3o` files
* scaling models using a factor
* recalculate the  normals of a model 
* a simple 3D-view (WIP, work in progress)

Support for more formats is also planned of course!
